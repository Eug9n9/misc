# Angular 1 Style Guide

## Angular Team Endorsed
Special thanks to Igor Minar, lead on the Angular team, for reviewing, contributing feedback, and entrusting me to shepherd this guide.

## Purpose
*Opinionated Angular style guide for teams by [@john_papa](//twitter.com/john_papa)*

If you are looking for an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, and structuring Angular applications, then step right in. These styles are based on my development experience with [Angular](//angularjs.org), presentations, [Pluralsight training courses](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/john-papa) and working in teams.

The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance on building Angular applications by showing the conventions I use and, more importantly, why I choose them.

>If you like this guide, check out my [Angular Patterns: Clean Code](http://jpapa.me/ngclean) course at Pluralsight which is a companion to this guide.

## Community Awesomeness and Credit
Never work in a vacuum. I find that the Angular community is an incredible group who are passionate about sharing experiences. As such, Angular expert Todd Motto and I have collaborated on many styles and conventions. We agree on most, and some we diverge. I encourage you to check out [Todd's guidelines](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide) to get a sense for his approach and how it compares.

Many of my styles have been from the many pair programming sessions [Ward Bell](https://twitter.com/wardbell) and I have had. My friend Ward has certainly helped influence the ultimate evolution of this guide.

## See the Styles in a Sample App
While this guide explains the *what*, *why* and *how*, I find it helpful to see them in practice. This guide is accompanied by a sample application that follows these styles and patterns. You can find the [sample application (named modular) here](https://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos) in the `modular` folder. Feel free to grab it, clone it, or fork it. [Instructions on running it are in its readme](https://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos/tree/master/modular).

##Translations
[Translations of this Angular style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1/i18n) are maintained by the community and can be found here.

## Single Responsibility

### Rule of 1
###### [Style [Y001](#style-y001)]

  - Define 1 component per file, recommended to be less than 500 lines of code.

  *Why?*: One component per file promotes easier unit testing and mocking.

  *Why?*: One component per file makes it far easier to read, maintain, and avoid collisions with teams in source control.

  *Why?*: One component per file avoids hidden bugs that often arise when combining components in a file where they may share variables, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.

  The following example defines the `app` module and its dependencies, defines a controller, and defines a factory all in the same file.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  angular
      .module('app', ['ngRoute'])
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController)
      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);

  function SomeController() { }

  function someFactory() { }
  ```

  The same components are now separated into their own files.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // app.module.js
  angular
      .module('app', ['ngRoute']);
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // some.controller.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  function SomeController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // someFactory.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('someFactory', someFactory);

  function someFactory() { }
  ```

### Small Functions
###### [Style [Y002](#style-y002)]

  - Define small functions, no more than 75 LOC (less is better).

  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to test, especially when they do one thing and serve one purpose.

  *Why?*: Small functions promote reuse.

  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to read.

  *Why?*: Small functions are easier to maintain.

  *Why?*: Small functions help avoid hidden bugs that come with large functions that share variables with external scope, create unwanted closures, or unwanted coupling with dependencies.

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## IIFE
### JavaScript Closures
###### [Style [Y010](#style-y010)]

  - Wrap Angular components in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).

  *Why?*: An IIFE removes variables from the global scope. This helps prevent variables and function declarations from living longer than expected in the global scope, which also helps avoid variable collisions.

  *Why?*: When your code is minified and bundled into a single file for deployment to a production server, you could have collisions of variables and many global variables. An IIFE protects you against both of these by providing variable scope for each file.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  // logger.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('logger', logger);

  // logger function is added as a global variable
  function logger() { }

  // storage.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('storage', storage);

  // storage function is added as a global variable
  function storage() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /**
   * recommended
   *
   * no globals are left behind
   */

  // logger.js
  (function() {
      'use strict';

      angular
          .module('app')
          .factory('logger', logger);

      function logger() { }
  })();

  // storage.js
  (function() {
      'use strict';

      angular
          .module('app')
          .factory('storage', storage);

      function storage() { }
  })();
  ```

  - Note: For brevity only, the rest of the examples in this guide may omit the IIFE syntax.

  - Note: IIFE's prevent test code from reaching private members like regular expressions or helper functions which are often good to unit test directly on their own. However you can test these through accessible members or by exposing them through their own component. For example placing helper functions, regular expressions or constants in their own factory or constant.

## Modules

### Avoid Naming Collisions
###### [Style [Y020](#style-y020)]

  - Use unique naming conventions with separators for sub-modules.

  *Why?*: Unique names help avoid module name collisions. Separators help define modules and their submodule hierarchy. For example `app` may be your root module while `app.dashboard` and `app.users` may be modules that are used as dependencies of `app`.

### Definitions (aka Setters)
###### [Style [Y021](#style-y021)]

  - Declare modules without a variable using the setter syntax.

  *Why?*: With 1 component per file, there is rarely a need to introduce a variable for the module.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  var app = angular.module('app', [
      'ngAnimate',
      'ngRoute',
      'app.shared',
      'app.dashboard'
  ]);
  ```

  Instead use the simple setter syntax.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  angular
      .module('app', [
          'ngAnimate',
          'ngRoute',
          'app.shared',
          'app.dashboard'
      ]);
  ```

### Getters
###### [Style [Y022](#style-y022)]

  - When using a module, avoid using a variable and instead use chaining with the getter syntax.

  *Why?*: This produces more readable code and avoids variable collisions or leaks.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  var app = angular.module('app');
  app.controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  function SomeController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('SomeController', SomeController);

  function SomeController() { }
  ```

### Setting vs Getting
###### [Style [Y023](#style-y023)]

  - Only set once and get for all other instances.

  *Why?*: A module should only be created once, then retrieved from that point and after.

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // to set a module
  angular.module('app', []);

  // to get a module
  angular.module('app');
  ```

### Named vs Anonymous Functions
###### [Style [Y024](#style-y024)]

  - Use named functions instead of passing an anonymous function in as a callback.

  *Why?*: This produces more readable code, is much easier to debug, and reduces the amount of nested callback code.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('DashboardController', function() { })
      .factory('logger', function() { });
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */

  // dashboard.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .controller('DashboardController', DashboardController);

  function DashboardController() { }
  ```

  ```javascript
  // logger.js
  angular
      .module('app')
      .factory('logger', logger);

  function logger() { }
  ```

## Controllers

### controllerAs View Syntax
###### [Style [Y030](#style-y030)]

  - Use the [`controllerAs`](http://www.johnpapa.net/do-you-like-your-angular-controllers-with-or-without-sugar/) syntax over the `classic controller with $scope` syntax.

  *Why?*: Controllers are constructed, "newed" up, and provide a single new instance, and the `controllerAs` syntax is closer to that of a JavaScript constructor than the `classic $scope syntax`.

  *Why?*: It promotes the use of binding to a "dotted" object in the View (e.g. `customer.name` instead of `name`), which is more contextual, easier to read, and avoids any reference issues that may occur without "dotting".

  *Why?*: Helps avoid using `$parent` calls in Views with nested controllers.

  ```html
  <!-- avoid -->
  <div ng-controller="CustomerController">
      {{ name }}
  </div>
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- recommended -->
  <div ng-controller="CustomerController as customer">
      {{ customer.name }}
  </div>
  ```

### controllerAs Controller Syntax
###### [Style [Y031](#style-y031)]

  - Use the `controllerAs` syntax over the `classic controller with $scope` syntax.

  - The `controllerAs` syntax uses `this` inside controllers which gets bound to `$scope`

  *Why?*: `controllerAs` is syntactic sugar over `$scope`. You can still bind to the View and still access `$scope` methods.

  *Why?*: Helps avoid the temptation of using `$scope` methods inside a controller when it may otherwise be better to avoid them or move the method to a factory, and reference them from the controller. Consider using `$scope` in a controller only when needed. For example when publishing and subscribing events using [`$emit`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$emit), [`$broadcast`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$broadcast), or [`$on`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$on).

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function CustomerController($scope) {
      $scope.name = {};
      $scope.sendMessage = function() { };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended - but see next section */
  function CustomerController() {
      this.name = {};
      this.sendMessage = function() { };
  }
  ```

### controllerAs with vm
###### [Style [Y032](#style-y032)]

  - Use a capture variable for `this` when using the `controllerAs` syntax. Choose a consistent variable name such as `vm`, which stands for ViewModel.

  *Why?*: The `this` keyword is contextual and when used within a function inside a controller may change its context. Capturing the context of `this` avoids encountering this problem.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function CustomerController() {
      this.name = {};
      this.sendMessage = function() { };
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function CustomerController() {
      var vm = this;
      vm.name = {};
      vm.sendMessage = function() { };
  }
  ```

  Note: You can avoid any [jshint](http://jshint.com/) warnings by placing the comment above the line of code. However it is not needed when the function is named using UpperCasing, as this convention means it is a constructor function, which is what a controller is in Angular.

  ```javascript
  /* jshint validthis: true */
  var vm = this;
  ```

  Note: When creating watches in a controller using `controller as`, you can watch the `vm.*` member using the following syntax. (Create watches with caution as they add more load to the digest cycle.)

  ```html
  <input ng-model="vm.title"/>
  ```

  ```javascript
  function SomeController($scope, $log) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.title = 'Some Title';

      $scope.$watch('vm.title', function(current, original) {
          $log.info('vm.title was %s', original);
          $log.info('vm.title is now %s', current);
      });
  }
  ```

  Note: When working with larger codebases, using a more descriptive name can help ease cognitive overhead & searchability. Avoid overly verbose names that are cumbersome to type.

  ```html
  <!-- avoid -->
  <input ng-model="customerProductItemVm.text">
  ```

  ```html
  <!-- recommended -->
  <input ng-model="productVm.id">
  ```

### Bindable Members Up Top
###### [Style [Y033](#style-y033)]

  - Place bindable members at the top of the controller, alphabetized, and not spread through the controller code.

    *Why?*: Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller can be bound and used in the View.

    *Why?*: Setting anonymous functions in-line can be easy, but when those functions are more than 1 line of code they can reduce the readability. Defining the functions below the bindable members (the functions will be hoisted) moves the implementation details down, keeps the bindable members up top, and makes it easier to read.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function SessionsController() {
      var vm = this;

      vm.gotoSession = function() {
        /* ... */
      };
      vm.refresh = function() {
        /* ... */
      };
      vm.search = function() {
        /* ... */
      };
      vm.sessions = [];
      vm.title = 'Sessions';
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function SessionsController() {
      var vm = this;

      vm.gotoSession = gotoSession;
      vm.refresh = refresh;
      vm.search = search;
      vm.sessions = [];
      vm.title = 'Sessions';

      ////////////

      function gotoSession() {
        /* */
      }

      function refresh() {
        /* */
      }

      function search() {
        /* */
      }
  }
  ```

    ![Controller Using "Above the Fold"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/master/a1/assets/above-the-fold-1.png)

  Note: If the function is a 1 liner consider keeping it right up top, as long as readability is not affected.

  ```javascript
  /* avoid */
  function SessionsController(data) {
      var vm = this;

      vm.gotoSession = gotoSession;
      vm.refresh = function() {
          /**
           * lines
           * of
           * code
           * affects
           * readability
           */
      };
      vm.search = search;
      vm.sessions = [];
      vm.title = 'Sessions';
  }
  ```

  ```javascript
  /* recommended */
  function SessionsController(sessionDataService) {
      var vm = this;

      vm.gotoSession = gotoSession;
      vm.refresh = sessionDataService.refresh; // 1 liner is OK
      vm.search = search;
      vm.sessions = [];
      vm.title = 'Sessions';
  }
  ```
### Function Declarations to Hide Implementation Details
## [Style [Y034](#style-y034)]

  - Use function declarations to hide implementation details. Keep your bindable members up top. When you need to bind a function in a controller, point it to a function declaration that appears later in the file. This is tied directly to the section Bindable Members Up Top. For more details see [this post](http://www.johnpapa.net/angular-function-declarations-function-expressions-and-readable-code/).

    *Why?*: Placing bindable members at the top makes it easy to read and helps you instantly identify which members of the controller can be bound and used in the View. (Same as above.)

    *Why?*: Placing the implementation details of a function later in the file moves that complexity out of view so you can see the important stuff up top.

    *Why?*: Function declaration are hoisted so there are no concerns over using a function before it is defined (as there would be with function expressions).

    *Why?*: You never have to worry with function declarations that moving `var a` before `var b` will break your code because `a` depends on `b`.


  /**
   * avoid
   * Using function expressions.
   */
  function AvengersController(avengersService, logger) {
      var vm = this;
      vm.avengers = [];
      vm.title = 'Avengers';

      var activate = function() {
          return getAvengers().then(function() {
              logger.info('Activated Avengers View');
          });
      }
      activate();
  }
